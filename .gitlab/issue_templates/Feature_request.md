## Feature Request

<!--
**Description:**
*   A concise and clear summary of the feature being requested.
    *   Example: "Implement a user profile page with settings and activity history."


**Role:**
*   _owner_
-->

### User Story (Narrative)
<<<<<<< HEAD

<!--
**Purpose:**
*   Describe the feature from the user's perspective.
*   This must be either the text itself or a link to the parent issue.
**Purpose:**
*   Describe the feature from the user's perspective.
*   This must be either the text itself or a link to the parent issue.
*   Use the "As a... I want... so that..." format for clarity.
    *   Example: "As a registered user, I want to be able to view and edit my profile information, such as name, email, and password, so that I can maintain an accurate and up-to-date account."
*   If this story is sized as L and on here may be a list of its child issues.

### Additional Context

<!--
**Purpose:**
*   Provide any relevant background information, dependencies, or constraints.
*   Include links to related documents, such as design mockups (Figma files), API documentation, or relevant research.
    *   Example:
        *   "This feature requires integration with the existing user authentication system."
        *   "Design mockups can be found in the following Figma file: [link]"

**Role:**
*   _owner_
*   _dev_
*   _ux-ui_

### Acceptance Criteria

<!--
**Purpose:**
*   Define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria for determining if the feature is complete and meets requirements.
    *   Example:
        *   "The user profile page must display the user's name, email address, and registration date."
        *   "Users must be able to successfully update their email address and password."
        *   "The profile page must load within 2 seconds on average."

### What's the impact of the feature on the project

<!--
e.g. The subpage will promote an event on which will help to connect the volunteers with Refugee Accomodation centers in Berlin

**Role:**
*   _owner_

## Technical Articulation

<!--
**Purpose:**
*   Optional
*   Describe the technical aspects of the feature implementation.
    * SW design, i.e. functions, data structures, API interfaces, etc.
    * Testing, performance, maintenance, etc.

**Role:**
*   _dev_
*   _sw-arch_
-->

### Proposed Solution

<!--
**Purpose:**
*   Outline the technical approach to implementing the feature.
    *   Example:
        *   "Create a new React component for the user profile page."
        *   "Utilize the existing user API to fetch and update user data."
        *   "Implement data validation and error handling."

**Role:**
*   _dev_
*   _sw-arch_
-->

### Size

<!--
**Purpose:**
*   Estimate the development effort required for the feature (e.g., small, medium, large, extra large).
    *   Use T-shirt sizing: XS, S, MS, M, L, XL, XXL
    *   S is a golden ratio meaning it's complexity and scale is within 2 and 4 hours of dev work.
    *   XS is about 1 hour and less
    *   MS is up to 1 day
    *   M is up to 1 day also, but has substantial complexity to it
    *   L is definitely more than a day, but doesn't exceed 3 days, i.e. 2 Ls per week
    *   XL takes entire week
    *   XXL just for indicating a huge one.
*   This can be used for planning and prioritization.
